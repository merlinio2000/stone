- while loop as combination of branches and conditions
- for loops must be implemented by their equivalent while loop


# limitations

because of the limited range of conditional (and a bit less unconditional) [[Branches]] a conditional block of code can not be larger than -256..254 bytes

# Selection

## if

## switch

implemented using a **jump table**

# Loop

## do-while
**POST** test
